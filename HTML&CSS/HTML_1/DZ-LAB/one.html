    <div><h1>Vehicle</h1>

        A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum <sup>[1]</sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. <br>
        Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), <br>
        watercraft (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) <br>
        and spacecraft.<sup>[2]</sup><br>
        <br>
        Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: <br>
        wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, <br>
        for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup>[3]</sup> <br>
